# 42-Yerevan-Libft
Re-writing various library functions and storing in my own library
First Project I completed at 42 Yerevan. The Goal is to create a library of useful pre-existing functions that students coded themselves. 
An excellent challenge for understanding what some library functions do under the hood.
As well as covering Linked Lists (bonuses) and Makefiles
